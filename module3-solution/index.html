                            While there are some popular ingredients like salmon and tuna that can be found year-round, sushi is the perfect example of Japan’s seasonality in cuisine. For visiting tourists, it’s a chance to explore the many restaurants promoting the highest quality of seafood the season can offer with many sushi counters serving up fish caught earlier in the morning! Read through our sushi types list to learn more about some of the most popular types you’ll encounter in Japan. Outside of Japan, sushi is considered by many as the quintessential Japanese food though it often takes on the Westernized appearance of sushi rolls, like the California roll or the salmon and avocado roll. But beyond what you may already know, there is a wide range of differing shapes, sizes, and flavors that have continued to develop in Japan since the 8th century. Makizushi, also known as “norimaki,” refers to a type of sushi where rice and ingredients are carefully rolled in a sheet of nori seaweed, which is then cut into smaller pieces. It’s believed that makizushi came into existence in the early 1700s, soon after sheet nori was invented with a similar technique used for paper making. The name norimaki is made up of two Japanese words: “Maki” meaning to roll and “nori” referring to the toasted sheet of nori seaweed used to wrap the ingredients.
